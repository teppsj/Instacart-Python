# Instacart Project
## Overview

The material in this repository shows off my Python work for Instacart. I was tasked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation. They wanted to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of products.  

The Instacart stakeholders asked the following questions:
* What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
* Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
* Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
* The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region? 
  - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family  status? 
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
